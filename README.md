Welcome to my personal projects portfolio, here I will showcase what I've worked on in Python in my own time. I'm passionate about programming and data analysis, and eager to apply and strengthen these skills further.

# PROJECT 1 (2022 FIFA World Cup Qatar web scraping)
  This project involved scraping data from FBref for matches in the 2022 FIFA World Cup to carry out analysis with the aid of a number of charts. The following web links were scraped: https://fbref.com/en/comps/1/World-Cup-Stats, https://fbref.com/en/comps/1/schedule/World-Cup-Scores-and-Fixtures.

  WCmatches, WCrankings - datasets used

# PROJECT 2 (Population Pyramid) 
  This project involved making use of publicly available data from the 2021 census to create a population pyramid showing the distribution of male and female age groups in England and Wales. I also attempted a curve fit for the historical population trend of England and Wales, to enable making predictions for the population in the future.

# PROJECT 3 (Car price prediction)
  This project involved using second hand car data from Kaggle to fit a multi linear regression model, enabling to make predictions for the car price given an entered set of parameters.

# PROJECT 4 (Diabetes prediction)
  This project involved using a diabetes dataset from Kaggle to fit a logistic regression and random forest model, enabling to make a prediction for if a patient is diabetic.

# PROJECT 5 (Holiday file sorting)
  One of my other interests is video editing, and when I go on holidays with my friends, I like to create "vlogs" with our collective recorded footage. A dillema I face when creating these vlogs is that sorting through a large quantity of footage to figure out which day of the holiday each video corresponded to can require a significant investment of time, and thus I had the idea to explore automating this process with Python. I created a script which accesses the metadata of each video, and uses that data to order the videos by the recording date.
